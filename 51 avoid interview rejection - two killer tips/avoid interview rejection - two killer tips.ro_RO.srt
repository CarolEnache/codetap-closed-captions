1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Cum să eviți să fii respins la interiviu?

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,033
Două sfaturi criminale pentru dezvoltatori web sau programatori.

3
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:10,999
Te duci des la interviuri și te simți depăsit?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Ți se pun întrebări greu de răspuns sau pentru care nu le știi răspunsul?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,400
Le arăți că știi ceva în timp ce ei se așteaptă la altceva?

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,000
Hai să aflăm cum poți lua controlul interviului înapoi.

7
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:26,199
Înainte de "Sfatul #1" spune-mi de unde ești într-un comentariu mai jos?

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,866
și cât este ora acum?

9
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:30,632
Sfatul #1

10
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:34,133
Ar trebui să începi prin a le aduce aminte că natura interviului este

11
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:35,799
de a vă cunoaște mai bine.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,433
iar acest proces este limitat de timpul alocat interviului.

13
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:42,933
Ar trebui să închizi afirmația cu:

14
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:44,633
Cred că toți suntem de acord cu asta

15
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:48,699
altfel nu ar mai exista interviuri secundare.

16
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:54,033
Acest lucru va înmuia atmosfera și îi va deschide pentru urmatoarea întrebare

17
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:58,033
Urmează prin a le cere să faci o concept dovadă.

18
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:03,333
un proiect mic prin care să le dovedești de ce ești în stare înainte să ia o decizie.

19
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,566
Așa ca întreabă ce ar dori să te vadă lucrând pentru ei?

20
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,999
Dacă au vreo preferință pentru o anumită tehnologie ...

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,200
sau dacă ești liber să le arăți tot ce ai mai bun.

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,566
This will definitely raise their interest and unless there are some unknown factors

23
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:19,532
you should get a chance for a second interview with them

24
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:23,166
You can approach the solution to this project as you wish

25
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:28,499
as well as to tailor a story about why you took a certain approach over another

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,566
and how would that benefit them either in short run or in the long run

27
00:01:33,566 --> 00:01:38,032
Now SMASH that Like button for TIP #1 cause I know you like what you hear

28
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:40,033
Tip #2

29
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:44,033
Following the "learn to code like a pro", "build your online resume" and

30
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:47,233
"build a quick blog" playlists of CodeTap

31
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:52,633
you'll discover how to create client optimised websites

32
00:01:52,633 --> 00:01:56,633
that can achieve a perfect 
Google Page Speed Score

33
00:01:56,633 --> 00:02:01,166
That means that your projects, your websites are 100% search engine optimised

34
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,932
are very very SEO friendly.

35
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:07,299
with this asset in your hand, prepare ahead of the interview

36
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,733
go grab the link of the page of the interviewer as well as

37
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:15,833
3 to 5 links of their top competitors

38
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:20,566
or if it's a Digital Agency, 3 to 5 links of their clients

39
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:23,566
and get back to them with something like:

40
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:26,732
how would you like me to help you out

41
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:32,266
to optimise you web page and stand out in front of your competitors

42
00:02:32,266 --> 00:02:37,499
How would you like me to help you out so you'd be able to go to your clients

43
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,800
and propose to them to get a perfect Google Page Speed Score

44
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,866
on their website and crush their competitors on this level.

45
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:49,932
with this said, the interview is not even over, it's in progress

46
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:53,833
and you're already providing them with possible future value.

47
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,533
they can see in you potential

48
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:59,399
Now smash that LIKE button for "Tip #2"

49
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,266
Those two tips helped me as well as some of my students and friends and colleagues 

50
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:10,266
to get their dream job or at least have a higher chance in the interview process

51
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:12,299

00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:20,399
so smash that Subscribe Button Now and smash that like button as well.

54
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,600
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you for so much smashing, I like your smashing

55
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,300
And as always: Happy Coding and Create something awesome!
