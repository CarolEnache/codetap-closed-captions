How to avoid interview rejections?

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,033
Two killer tips for web developers and coders

3
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:10,999
Do you often go to interviews and feel a bit overwhelmed?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Do you get questions that are hard to answer or you don't know how to?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,400
Are you showing them some skills while they are expecting something else?

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's find out how you can gain back control of the interview.

7
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:26,199
Before "Tip #1" let me know where are you from?

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,866
And what time is it you're watching this movie?

9
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:30,632
Now TIP #1

10
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:34,133
You should start by reminding them that the nature of the interview

11
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:35,799
is to get to know each other better

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,433
And that this process is limited by time which is the length of the interview

13
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:42,933
You should end this statement with something like:

14
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:44,633
I think we can all agree with this 

15
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:48,699
cause this is why second and follow up interviews are meant for

16
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:54,033
This will set a positive mood and will open them up for your next question

17
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:58,033
Follow this up by asking them for a POC, that's a "proof of concept"

18
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:03,333
it's a small project that you can work on and deliver it before they make their final decision

19
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,566
So ask what would they like to see you building for them?

20
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,999
If they like a particular technology to be used ...

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,200
or if you're free to show your best

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,566
This will definitely raise their interest and unless there are some unknown factors

23
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:19,532
you should get a chance for a second interview with them

24
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:23,166
You can approach the solution to this project as you wish

25
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:28,499
as well as to tailor a story about why you took a certain approach over another

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,566
and how would that benefit them either in short run or in the long run

27
00:01:33,566 --> 00:01:38,032
Now SMASH that Like button for TIP #1 cause I know you like what you hear

28
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:40,033
Tip #2

29
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:44,033
Following the "learn to code like a pro", "build your online resume" and

30
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:47,233

00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:52,633

32

that can achieve a perfect 
Google Page Speed Score

33

That means that your projects, your websites are 100% search engine optimised

34
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,932
are very very SEO friendly.

35
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:07,299
with this asset in your hand, prepare ahead of the interview

36
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,733
go grab the link of the page of the interviewer as well as

37
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:15,833
3 to 5 links of their top competitors

38
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:20,566
or if it's a Digital Agency, 3 to 5 links of their clients

39
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:23,566
and get back to them with something like:

40
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:26,732
how would you like me to help you out

41
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:32,266
to optimise you web page and stand out in front of your competitors

42
00:02:32,266 --> 00:02:37,499
How would you like me to help you out so you'd be able to go to your clients

43
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,800
and propose to them to get a perfect Google Page Speed Score

44
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,866
on their website and crush their competitors on this level.

45
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:49,932
with this said, the interview is not even over, it's in progress

46
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:53,833
and you're already providing them with possible future value.

47
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,533
they can see in you potential

48
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:59,399
Now smash that LIKE button for "Tip #2"

49
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,266
Those two tips helped me as well as some of my students and friends and colleagues 

50
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:10,266
to get their dream job or at least have a higher chance in the interview process
