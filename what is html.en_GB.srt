00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,133
This is CodeTap
I'm Marian

2
00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:03,033
and I'm Carol

3
00:00:03,033 --> 00:00:04,499
and today we'll be talking about 

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,366
What is HTML? 

5
00:00:16,566 --> 00:00:18,999
So, what is HTML?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,133
Well, most tutors will tell you 
that HTML stands for:

7
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:24,433
Hyper Text
Markup Language

8
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:26,533
Isn't that adding up to the confusion?

9
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:30,033
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'd be even more confused too.

10
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:32,999
Let me translate
Geek into English

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,200
Let's switch to the big screen then.

12
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:42,733
OK. So, let's see what HTML does.

13
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:46,166
What's up with it?
What does it do?

14
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:53,866
When you write HTML, you actually
define the structure of a web page.

15
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:59,832
Let's dive in and see an example
of a very popular web site.

16
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,799
YouTube

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,833
I'll open Google Chrome browser
and Notepad

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,166
and set them side by side
and let's navigate to YouTube

19
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:19,533
OK, so we'll start writing down
the structure of YouTube

20
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:22,899
A very simple one to illustrate the purpose.

21
00:01:23,366 --> 00:01:26,832
So, we can see that 
we have a top section here.

22
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:31,933
So let's write "top-section"

23
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,000
and in that top section 
we have a logo

24
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:47,999
and the logo contains 
info about YouTube GB

25
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:56,866
OK, and after the logo, to its right side
we have a search

26
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,400
and after that we have a ...
let's call it "mini-menu"

27
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:10,933
'cause of some small icons
those ones, those three over here

28
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:15,866
So, in this mini-menu we have a

29
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:19,866
an upload icon

30
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:25,333
I think those are called alerts
so "alerts"

31
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:30,766
and the last one would be
the user profile

32
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,966
so far so good,
we could continue with

33
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:43,366
let's call it "menu list"

34
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:50,733
OK, and this one has a link

35
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:55,333
that gets you home

36
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:57,566
and another link

37
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:02,066
for trending

38
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:09,533
and another link for subscriptions

39
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,533
so, I think we can continue with this

40
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:21,266
we can call it the "content" section, OK?

41
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:25,099
so, because it has content in it

42
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,566
and we see recommended

43
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,166
and it's a list of movies
so "re..." list

44
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:40,966
and inside it we have "movie 1"

45
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:47,966
movie two, movie three, and so on.

46
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:54,533
and we have a "watch it again" list, "lifestyle"

47
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,133
so let me just copy / paste this

48
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:02,466
and say watch it again list

49
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:10,599
and we have again movies and so on and

50
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:13,232
later on we have more lists

51
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,500
later on we'll get to the bottom of it

52
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:19,832
we have a footer

53
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,166
so let's just jump to it, "footer"

54
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:25,466
and some footer

55
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:36,366
lots of nice content with lots of useful info

56
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:43,399
OK, so now we know that with HTML

57
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,366
you define the structure of a web page

58
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:50,066
in the next lesson, I'll reveal to you

59
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:52,666
The rules of writing HTML

60
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:56,833
the very very simple rules
of writing HTML

61
00:04:57,033 --> 00:05:00,266
so, see YOU in the next lesson!
