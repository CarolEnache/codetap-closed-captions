5 tips

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,100
on how to become a web developer coming up

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:16,333


4
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,466
Tip #1

5
00:00:17,466 --> 00:00:19,532
Volunteering or interning.

6
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:22,166
This is the quickest way to get hired

7
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,499
or freelance as a web developer.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,166
The very first time that I started doing web stuff was for a clan of gamers I was part of.

9
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:34,299
It started as a passion, as I wanted us to be online somehow,

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,633
and stand out in front of other gaming clans.

11
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:41,066
Soon after, I’ve done the website for the internet cafe

12
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:46,466
where I was volunteering to help out with network administration and clients.

13
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:49,932
In exchange I got access to internet and computers

14
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:53,933
since at that time I didn’t own one nor had the money to buy it.

15
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:56,366
Some of you might relate to this.

16
00:00:56,366 --> 00:00:58,099
So your question might be:

17
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,933
Hey, is there someone in the local area that needs their website done?

18
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:07,499
Or … Can I join as an intern and learn from the more experienced web developers?

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,766
Tip #2

20
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:12,299
Say yes to every website, including unpaid ones.

21
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,933
This doesn’t mean that you should always work for free.

22
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:21,499
Your goal is to gain experience in the real world as quickly as possible and build your portfolio.

23
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,000
With the free ones you can say something like this:

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,133
Let’s help each other out. I’ll build this website for you for free

25
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:31,833
and in return, at the end, if you’re happy with my work

26
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:37,199
feel free to help me out and pay whatever you think it worths or what you can afford.

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,300
I’ve done lots of websites for friends and family for free which gave me a lot of confidence.

28
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,966
So start saying yes now by smashing that like button!

29
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:48,566
Tip #3

30
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,932
Build your portfolio.

31
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:54,133
I’ll start by assuring you that this step is totally optional.

32
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:58,999
I know lots of coders including myself that started without a portfolio.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,833
However, if you are not confident and don’t have the guts to speak for yourself

34
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:06,666
and sell a good value to your possible employer or client,

35
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:10,132
the portfolio, your work, will speak for you.

36
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:11,566
So where do you put your work?

37
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:16,299
Well, this can be your own web site and I recommend this if you want to look professional.

38
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,166
Those days you can get pretty good cheap deals to buy a domain name.

39
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,566
I use gandi.net.

40
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:26,399
You can also host it on GitHub.com and GitHub.io all for FREE.

41
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,933
Check the playlist “Learn to code like PRO”

42
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:31,866
and “Build your online resume” which you can find

43
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:34,466
in the links above or in the description below.

44
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:35,766
Tip #4

45
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:39,999
Find a mentor and join local or online coding groups.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,100
You can find lots of those ones on FaceBook, LinkedIn

47
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,700
or google for the ones that suits you most.

48
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,866
You want to identify and follow the best ones in web development

49
00:02:49,866 --> 00:02:53,366
and gain as much experience as you can from them

50
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:59,632
so one day you’d become better and inspire others just like yourself at this time.

51
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:06,466
90% of the time spent as a beginner is looking at errors and doing things the wrong way.

52
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:09,199
Finding a mentor is a game changer.

53
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,966
A mentor will guide you on the right path if you go too far sideways.

54
00:03:13,966 --> 00:03:19,566
I’ll be happy to be your online mentor and I aim to answer all questions I’m able to.

55
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:23,566
Uuuuu, online mentor? Sounds cool? Hell ya so smash that like button.

56
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:25,466
Tip #5

57
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:26,699
Get the word out.

58
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,700
Building websites, paid or free, come on ....
Building websites, paid or free, come on ....

59
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,700
Building websites, building websites, paid or free

60
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:42,366
How? Well there is this thing called “Social Media” like: YouTube, StackOverflow, GitHub,

61
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:46,199
all the forums you can think of in your niche and so many more.

62
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,500
Attend local networking events like: Free Code Camp, Google Campus and so many more.

63
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,500
I’ve found lots o them on meetup.com so go on and check it out.

64
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,500
This is how you’ll make new connections and how people will discover you.

65
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,500
You’ll build your online presence, brick by brick with:

66
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,366
Each meeting you attend and interact with people

67
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:12,399
Each question you answer on a forum, group or special website like StackOverflow

68
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,733
Each “pull request” to a public open source project on GitHub

69
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:21,499
A few brick layers or even an entire wall with 

70
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,500
each cool public project you work on available on GitHub

71
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:28,033
If you’re new over here this is CodeTap

72
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:32,166
where you’ll discover how to build websites and 
get paid well.

73
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:35,899
So smash that like button and subscribe now if you haven’t done so. 

74
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,400
Thanks for watching and as always:

75
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,166
happy coding and create something awesome!

76
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:45,499
Come one, building ....
